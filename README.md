# Computational-literacy-project
This study is conducted to answer the research question: 
“What are the differences or similarities in the depiction of ghosts in two Chinese fictional novels from different eras?” 
The aim is to find high-frequency words that appear near (either before or after) the word “ghost” and compare the collocations between novels. 
The concordances of the collocations should be also read through to get a better idea of the relation of the words.
